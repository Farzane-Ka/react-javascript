This project is a restaurant webpage, where users can add foods from a list to the cart-shop.
The cart-shop button opens a window where users can change their order; for example add more or remove the items, and also it shows the total price for the order.
React hooks that are used are UseState, UseRef, UseContext, UseReducer. UseContext is used to manage the state of the ordered food. In this application,
many components have access to the state of the ordered food and change it dynamically based on the user's interaction. For example, the cart-shop and its inner components,
and the add button in the mange page need to access the ordered food.
