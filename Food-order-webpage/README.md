This project is a restaurant webpage, where users can add foods from a list to the cart-shop.
The cart-shop button opens a window where users can change their order; for example add more or remove the items.
React hooks that are used are UseState, UseRef, UseContext. UseContext is used to manage the state of ordered food in this application since
many components must have access to change the state of ordered food based on user's interaction. For example, the cart-shop and its inner components,
and the add button in the mange page need to access the ordered food.
